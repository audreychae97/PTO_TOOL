# PTO_TOOL
Hey corporate employees! Tired of having to update multiple third-party applications before going off to use PTO? Let's automate that!

This project is a beginner's prototype to creating a web application that allows employees to enter their requested PTO in one spot.
Employees enter a desired time for PTO, and this application will update the following applications:

- Kronos: Log hours and check balance accordingly 
- Outlook + Skype: Update automatic responses 
- MySQL database (later to be changed to Azure): for logging purposes

**This project is still a work in progress with an expected implementation time slot of 3~4 months**

The application uses the following tools:

Back-end:
- Java + Spring Boot API

Front-end:
- Angular 6 
- Bootstrap

Storage:
- MySQL
